  <div class="block-text" id="about-wine-open">
    Primitive civilizations were convinced that fermentation involved divine spirit intervention. Following this piece of ancient wisdom, we developed Passion Tropicale .
    Made by fermenting passion fruit juice, this wine offers a surprisingly fruity, mellow and slightly tart bouquet. It’s characterized by a remarkable lingering aftertaste with scents of citrus and sunlight.

    It is said that the recipe originates from the imaginary Island of Moyra, a Terres d’Ailleurs or a  Faraway Land. Legend has it that, there, the passiflora vines bear only passion fruit if they’re planted by couples deeply in love. This could explain the undeniable aphrodisiac properties of this wine.   </div>
